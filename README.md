> Program for automated typing.

Automatically types text in [Nitro Type](https://www.nitrotype.com). Using a simple graphical interface, you are able to specify speed, accuracy, amount of races and more!

## Differences from other bots:

1. Undetectable. Sandbox is full of random variables and Nitro Type will not be able to detect that it is a program completing your race.

2. Simple on the outside. Sandbox is incredibly easy to use, with a simple graphical interface.

3. Advanced on the inside. Sandbox has many amazing features that have been programmed with maximum efficency.

Nitros: (True / False / Random) True = Use Nitros, False = Dont use nitros, Random = Random chance that you will use Nitros.
